## 🚀 What This Is

A unified AI-powered macroeconomic dashboard that solves a messy reality: **data is scattered, hard to clean, and harder to interpret**. Governments and institutions publish thousands of economic indicators, but none tell a complete story. Instead of hunting through dozens of government databases and losing signal in the noise, get the complete economic picture in one place.

## 🎯 Built For

**Economic intelligence without the data engineering.** For analysts, strategists, and decision-makers who need to spot market shifts and assess cross-sector risks before competitors do.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Economic analysis today means wrestling with fragmented data:

* **Scattered sources** — World Bank, IMF, central banks, defense agencies across 20+ institutions
* **Inconsistent formats** — different units, time periods, and data structures
* **Hidden connections** — energy shocks affecting manufacturing, defense spending signaling geopolitical risk
* **Analysis paralysis** — hours lost in spreadsheets instead of strategic thinking
* **No reusable framework** — every analysis starts from scratch

---

## ⚙️ The Solution

**Macro Trends Dashboard** automatically:
* **Unifies 92 indicators** across 7 economic sectors into a single schema
* **Processes 160K+ records** from global institutions into clean, comparable data  
* **Identifies patterns** using AI to spot correlations humans miss
* **Generates insights** with sector-specific risk assessments and trend analysis
* **Delivers clarity** through interactive dashboards requiring no data science background

**Example**: Spot how rising defense budgets correlate with currency volatility weeks before it impacts your sector.
